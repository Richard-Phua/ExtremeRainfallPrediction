# Analysis of Extreme Rainfall Events in Malaysia

<p align='justify'> Extreme rainfall is one of the areas of study that researchers have been interested in until now. Extreme rainfall can be caused by the monsoon season, especially the northeast monsoon season which leads to floods that damage the economy and society. To find the pattern of extreme rainfall distribution, five distributions: exponential distribution, gamma distribution, generalised extreme value distribution, generalised Pareto distribution and Weibull distribution are fitted using the extreme rainfall from 12 stations in Kelantan, Malaysia. The extreme rainfall is selected by using the peak-over-threshold (POT) and the best-fit probability distribution is selected based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling test. The result shows that the generalised Pareto distribution describes the extreme rainfall in Kelantan the most followed by the generalised extreme value distribution. The extreme rainfall is compared with the global circulation model that was fitted into quantile regression using box and whisker plot. The plot shows that December is the month when the extreme rainfall events usually occur. </p>
